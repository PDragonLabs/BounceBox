# BounceBox
3d objects rotating and bouncing in a box js



This project is a web-based 3D simulation created with Three.js. It features various 3D objects (spheres, cubes, and tori) that bounce off the walls of a transparent wireframe box and rotate randomly. Each object has a unique color, initial position, velocity, and rotation speed, resulting in a dynamic visual demonstration of 3D object behavior within constraints.
